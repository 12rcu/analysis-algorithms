# Analysis Algorithms

![build](https://github.com/12rcu/analysis-algorithms/actions/workflows/gradle_build.yml/badge.svg)

This is a fun little project where I tried to code some algorithms from an analysis script to better understand them. If
you want to use some algorithms just copy and paste them into your own project, this is not a library published anywhere
and is also not intended.

## Supported Algorithms

- p-norm 
- distance between 2 points in n-dimensional space
- BÃ©zier curve (one dimension)
